Thane ActionScript Engine
-------------------------

Thane is a lightly modified version of Tamarin (http://www.mozilla.org/projects/tamarin/) with
a partial Flash Player compatibility layer written mostly in ActionScript with a bit of native
glue.

 * The engine itself was modified to run on Unix platforms under x86_64 architecture. The existing
   Windows/64 support was extended for the Unix ABI (http://www.x86-64.org/documentation.html).
   JIT mode is currently not available for this architecture: a future versions of Tamarin will
   be updated for the most recent Tamarin code base and its enhanced code generation subsystem.

 * The compatibility layer adds many of the abilities of the Flash Player library that make
   sense in a server environment: sockets, event dispatching, timers, geometry classes, etc.


Fair Warning
------------

 * This code is in mid-development and anything and everything in it is likely to change without
   notice. We will document the changes, but provide no backward compatibility support.

 * As suggested above, our code is out of sync with upstream Tamarin and merging with their
   changes is a priority -- currently pending investigation into the quality of the Unix/64
   support in the new LIR code generation engine.
