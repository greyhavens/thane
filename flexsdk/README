We have two modifications to the Flex SDK. The upstream source can be gotten thus:

  svn checkout http://opensource.adobe.com/svn/opensource/flex/sdk/trunk flexsdk

The two modifications are:

 - The ASC ant task in the SDK irritatingly requires FLEX_HOME set. We remove that requirement,
   and change the switch syntax to conform more to what we're used to. More importantly, we add
   an AscLibTask class.

 - To extract all the .abc from a .swf, we have a lightly patched version of SwfxPrinter,
   including a patch to ASC's optimizer so it doesn't automatically remove all debug symbols
   without being asked to do so.

Apply the diffs:

   patch -p0 < *.diff

Then just 'ant' to rebuild the SDK.
