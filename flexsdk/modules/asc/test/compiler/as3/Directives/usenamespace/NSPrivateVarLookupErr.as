 *  SECTION           -- section of testing
 *                    -- for example: "Directives" or "Array"
 *  VERSION           -- either "ECMA3" or "AS3"

 *
 *  Running the test
 *
 *  There are three possible environments that tests can
 *  run in
 *
 *  spidermonkey  - mozilla.org ECMA 3 tests only, should not need to write any
 *                  more than what we have from mozilla.org
 *
 *                  * use shell.as
 *
 *  Flash MX 2004 - existing Actionscript 2.0 environment.  Only tests
 *                  that are supported by Flash 7 will run here
 *
 *                  * use shellMX2004.as
 *
 *  ASC/AVMPlus   - All tests written must compile and run here
 *
 *                  * use shellASC.as
