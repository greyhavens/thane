// This is designed to be executed by the 'Windows Scripting Host'.

// The Windows Scripting Host and the executables are provided by Microsoft.
// It is a script engine that exposes objects named 'WSH' and 'WScript' - 
// this is a test of using that object.

// Execute this via:
//   % cscript.exe /E:application/ecmascript;version=4 wsh_simple.es4
// You can also use wscript.exe if you prefer, but cscript.exe provides a
// console, so may be better for diagnostics.
// (Note: we could register the .es4 extension, making this less ugly)

WScript.Echo("Hello from es4/wsh")
WScript.Echo("WSH version is " + WScript.Version)
