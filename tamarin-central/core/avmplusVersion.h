// AVMPLUS_MAJOR_VERSION and AVMPLUS_MINOR_VERSION track the engine generation
// and release number within a generation, respectively.

// AVMPLUS_MAJOR_VERSION is updated when we think it is appropriate to do so
// (major technology change, incompatible API changes maybe, new bytecodes
// maybe).  The rules for this are not set in stone.  It signifies that
// "something important just happened".  We have to just reach a consensus on
// whether something should trigger a change.
// 
// AVMPLUS_MINOR_VERSION is updated on /every/ merge from tamarin-redux
// to tamarin-central and is therefore a serial number for the release.
//
// AVMPLUS_MAJOR_DATE and AVMPLUS_MINOR_DATE reflect the dates of the incrementing
// of the major and minor version numbers, respectively, for the current code.
