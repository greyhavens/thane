# comments begin with #
# fields are: TESTNAME, CONFIGURATION, COMMANDS, DETAILS
# each field separate by , and whitespace is removed before/after from each field
#
# TESTNAME may contain : testcase (for the vm tests) : is the separator
# TESTNAME and testcase are regular expressions and can match multiple test files / test cases
#
# CONFIGURATION is also a regular expression
# CONFIGURATION format is {CPU_ARCH}-{OS}-{VM}-{VERSION}-{VMSWITCH}
#
# COMMANDS are currently : asc.args, expectedfailure, skip
#    expectedfailure - expects the test to fail, details should provide bug number and a comment
#    skip - the test is not run, for example the configuration does not support a feature or the file is not a test and is a helper file to another test
#    include - includes a specific testcase even if the parent has been skipped

# Example:

# fails when running the release vm with the -Dinterp vm arg, bug #401095
