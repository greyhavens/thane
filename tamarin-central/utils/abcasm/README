abcasm is an ABC assembler.

Usage: see abcasm.sh

Syntax: the assembler language is based on abcdump's output format.

Hacking:

1. Rebuilding the parser requires antlr-3.0.1 and antlr-2.7.7, 
(ANTLR to be upgraded to version 3.1). 

2. $ASC must point to asc.jar.

3. Put the paths to the ANTLR jarfiles in a build.properties file, e.g.

# ANTLR grammar regeneration support
# Note both ANTLR3 and ANTLR 2.7.7 are required, and both are provided
# by the 3.0.1 distribution.
lib.dir=C:/work/antlr-3.0.1

4. ant

Hacking with Eclipse:

1. make abcasm be the root of your eclipse project
2. add asc.jar, antlr-3.0.1.jar, and antlr-2.7.7.jar as external libraries
3. build with ant, first, to get gensrc/*.java
4. now you should be able to edit/save/test in eclipse
